<Verse ID="3" Number="3"> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</Verse>
<Verse ID="4" Number="4"> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</Verse>
<Verse ID="5" Number="5"> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</Verse>
<Verse ID="6" Number="6"> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</Verse>
<Verse ID="7" Number="7"> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:</Verse>
<Verse ID="8" Number="8"> And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</Verse>
<Verse ID="9" Number="9"> And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</Verse>
<Verse ID="10" Number="10"> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</Verse>
<Verse ID="11" Number="11"> And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, \add and\add* fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein</Verse>
<Verse ID="12" Number="12"> And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof,</Verse>
<Verse ID="13" Number="13"> And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</Verse>
<Verse ID="14" Number="14"> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for</Verse>
<Verse ID="15" Number="15"> and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</Verse>
<Verse ID="16" Number="16"> And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: \add he made\add* the</Verse>
<Verse ID="17" Number="17"> And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,</Verse>
<Verse ID="18" Number="18"> and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</Verse>
<Verse ID="19" Number="19"> And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</Verse>
<Verse ID="20" Number="20"> And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of</Verse>
<Verse ID="21" Number="21"> And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that moveth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after their kind, and</Verse>
<Verse ID="22" Number="22"> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</Verse>
<Verse ID="23" Number="23"> And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</Verse>
<Verse ID="24" Number="24"> And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures after their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth</Verse>
<Verse ID="25" Number="25"> And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creepeth upon the</Verse>
<Verse ID="26" Number="26"> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the</Verse>
<Verse ID="27" Number="27"> And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</Verse>
<Verse ID="28" Number="28"> And God blessed them: and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion</Verse>
<Verse ID="29" Number="29"> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which</Verse>
<Verse ID="30" Number="30"> and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is</Verse>
<Verse ID="31" Number="31"> And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth</Verse>
</Chapter>
<Chapter ID="2" Number="2">
<Verse ID="32" Number="1"> And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</Verse>
<Verse ID="33" Number="2"> And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had</Verse>
<Verse ID="34" Number="3"> And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</Verse>
<Verse ID="35" Number="4"> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.</Verse>
<Verse ID="36" Number="5"> And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to</Verse>
<Verse ID="37" Number="6"> but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</Verse>
<Verse ID="38" Number="7"> And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living</Verse>
<Verse ID="39" Number="8"> And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</Verse>
<Verse ID="40" Number="9"> And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in</Verse>
<Verse ID="41" Number="10"> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.</Verse>
<Verse ID="42" Number="11"> The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</Verse>
<Verse ID="43" Number="12"> and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</Verse>
<Verse ID="44" Number="13"> And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.</Verse>
<Verse ID="45" Number="14"> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</Verse>
<Verse ID="46" Number="15"> And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</Verse>
<Verse ID="47" Number="16"> And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</Verse>
<Verse ID="48" Number="17"> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt</Verse>
<Verse ID="49" Number="18"> And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.</Verse>
<Verse ID="50" Number="19"> And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to</Verse>
<Verse ID="51" Number="20"> And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not</Verse>
<Verse ID="52" Number="21"> And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh</Verse>
<Verse ID="53" Number="22"> and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</Verse>
<Verse ID="54" Number="23"> And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</Verse>
<Verse ID="55" Number="24"> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</Verse>
<Verse ID="56" Number="25"> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</Verse>
</Chapter>
<Chapter ID="3" Number="3">
<Verse ID="57" Number="1"> Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which Jehovah God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath</Verse>
<Verse ID="58" Number="2"> And the woman said unto the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat:</Verse>
<Verse ID="59" Number="3"> but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,</Verse>
<Verse ID="60" Number="4"> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</Verse>
<Verse ID="61" Number="5"> for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</Verse>
<Verse ID="62" Number="6"> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired</Verse>
<Verse ID="63" Number="7"> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves</Verse>
<Verse ID="64" Number="8"> And they heard the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and the man and his wife hid themselves from</Verse>
<Verse ID="65" Number="9"> And Jehovah God called unto the man, and said unto him, Where art thou?</Verse>
<Verse ID="66" Number="10"> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</Verse>
<Verse ID="67" Number="11"> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</Verse>
<Verse ID="68" Number="12"> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</Verse>
<Verse ID="69" Number="13"> And Jehovah God said unto the woman, What is this thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</Verse>
<Verse ID="70" Number="14"> And Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the</Verse>
<Verse ID="71" Number="15"> and I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt</Verse>
<Verse ID="72" Number="16"> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy</Verse>
<Verse ID="73" Number="17"> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded</Verse>
<Verse ID="74" Number="18"> thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</Verse>
<Verse ID="75" Number="19"> in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art,</Verse>
<Verse ID="76" Number="20"> And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</Verse>
<Verse ID="77" Number="21"> And Jehovah God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</Verse>
<Verse ID="78" Number="22"> And Jehovah God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take</Verse>
<Verse ID="79" Number="23"> therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</Verse>
<Verse ID="80" Number="24"> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every</Verse>

<Verse ID="81" Number="1"> And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with \add the help of\add* Jehovah.</Verse>
<Verse ID="82" Number="2"> And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</Verse>
<Verse ID="83" Number="3"> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto Jehovah.</Verse>
<Verse ID="84" Number="4"> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And Jehovah had respect unto Abel and to his</Verse>
<Verse ID="85" Number="5"> but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</Verse>
<Verse ID="86" Number="6"> And Jehovah said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</Verse>
<Verse ID="87" Number="7"> If thou doest well, shall it not be lifted up? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be its</Verse>
<Verse ID="88" Number="8"> And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and</Verse>
<Verse ID="89" Number="9"> And Jehovah said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?</Verse>
<Verse ID="90" Number="10"> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</Verse>
<Verse ID="91" Number="11"> And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;</Verse>
<Verse ID="92" Number="12"> when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the</Verse>
<Verse ID="93" Number="13"> And Cain said unto Jehovah, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</Verse>
<Verse ID="94" Number="14"> Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive</Verse>
<Verse ID="95" Number="15"> And Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah appointed a</Verse>

<Verse ID="97" Number="17"> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name</Verse>
<Verse ID="98" Number="18"> And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael; and Methushael begat Lamech.</Verse>
<Verse ID="99" Number="19"> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</Verse>
<Verse ID="100" Number="20"> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and \add have\add* cattle.</Verse>
<Verse ID="101" Number="21"> And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</Verse>
<Verse ID="102" Number="22"> And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was</Verse>
